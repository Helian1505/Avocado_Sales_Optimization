# 🥑 Avocado Sales Optimization: ROI Analysis for Quality Control Technology

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the financial impact of avocado maturity levels on retail sales in the Colombian market. By simulating 365 days of sales data for a large supermarket chain, this study quantifies the revenue lost due to consumer rejection of immature fruit and calculates the **Return on Investment (ROI)** of implementing an automated grading machine.

## 💼 Business Problem
In the Colombian retail sector, avocado (Hass variety) is a high-demand product. However, "purchase frustration" is common when consumers find the fruit too firm (immature) or damaged. 
* **Key Hypothesis:** Immature fruit on shelves leads to a direct 15% drop in potential daily sales.
* **Goal:** Determine if investing in a $150M COP grading machine is financially viable.

## 📊 Data & Methodology
Due to the proprietary nature of retail transactional data, this project utilizes a **synthetic dataset** built on real market parameters:
- **Market Price:** $5,000 COP/kg (approx. $1,000 COP per unit).
- **Consumption Data:** Based on MADR (Ministerio de Agricultura) reports of 12.3 kg per capita.
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. **Maturity-Sales Correlation:** Analysis confirmed a sharp increase in "Lost Units" whenever the average shelf maturity dropped below the **2.5 threshold** (on a 1-5 scale).
2. **Revenue Leakage:** Without technology, the chain loses approximately **$ 123,321,900 COP** annually due to preventable rejection.

## 🚀 The Solution: Automated Grading Machine
The proposed solution uses sensors to ensure only optimal fruit reaches the shelves, reducing the rejection rate from **15% to 3%**.

### Financial Results:
- **Initial Investment:** $150,000,000 COP
- **Annual Net Benefit:** $43,907,520 COP
- **Project ROI:** **29.27%**
- **Payback Period:** **41 Months**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Manipulation), Seaborn (Visualization), Scipy (Statistical Simulation).

## 📈 Conclusion
The data demonstrates that the grading machine is not just a quality improvement but a **highly profitable strategic investment**. With a payback period of less than 42 months, it is highly recommended for implementation.
